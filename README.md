# 🧵 **Vaibhav Furnishing Business Portal: HTML, CSS & JS-Only Implementation Plan**

---

## 🌱 Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Architecture

### 🎯 Goal:
Build a clean project structure using plain HTML, CSS, and JS with modular folders.

### ✅ Tasks:
- Create folders:
  ```
  /vaibhav-furnishing/
    ├── /assets/       → Images, icons, fonts
    ├── /styles/       → style.css, responsive.css
    ├── /scripts/      → main.js, utils.js
    ├── /pages/        → home.html, admin.html, sales.html, shop.html
    └── index.html     → Landing page (redirects to home)
  ```

- Link external styles and scripts inside each HTML page.
- Create a **Home Page** (`home.html`) with navigation to other pages (Admin, Sales, Shop).

## 🛍 Phase 2: Centralized Product & Pricing Management

### 🎯 Goal:
Simulate a product management system using local JS objects/arrays.

### ✅ Tasks:
- Create `admin.html` with:
  - **Add Product Form** (fields: name, category, selling price, cost price, image URL, description)
  - **Inline Product List** (dynamically generated from JS)
  - Auto-calculate `minDiscountedPrice = (sellingPrice - costPrice) / 2 + costPrice`

- Save product data in `localStorage` or in-memory array for session persistence.

- Style the dashboard using CSS grids or flexbox.

### 🎯 Goal:
Create a view-only version of products with discount validation logic.

### ✅ Tasks:
- Create `sales.html`:
  - Dropdown/select to choose product
  - Show: name, image, selling price, max discount allowed
  - Input: Final discounted price (within allowed range)
  - Generate **digital bill** (rendered JSON or downloadable .txt/.json)

## 📦 Phase 8: Inventory & Barcode Support

### 🎯 Goal:
Track stock and simulate barcode input.

### ✅ Tasks:

  ```js
  { quantityInStock, thresholdLevel }
  ```
